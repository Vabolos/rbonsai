## Inspiration

This project *also* wouldn't be here if it weren't for its roots!
`rbonsai` is a Rust version of `cbonsai`.
`cbonsai` is itself a newer version of [bonsai.sh](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/bonsai.sh), which was written in `bash` and was itself a port of [this bonsai tree generator](https://avelican.github.io/bonsai/) written in `javascript`.
